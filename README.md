# Reverse Shell Malware

This project is a **reverse shell malware** written in **C**, developed as part of studies in networks and cybersecurity. It allows an attacker to gain **remote control** of a machine and execute commands on the victim‚Äôs terminal.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **The attacker starts a listener** on the server to wait for connections.
2. **The victim executes the malware**, which:
   - Establishes a connection to the server.
   - Redirects the victim‚Äôs terminal (`cmd.exe`) to the created socket.
3. **The attacker gains full remote control** of the victim‚Äôs machine.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

### 1. Development Environment
- **Operating System**: Windows
- **Compiler**: GCC (MinGW for Windows)
- **Library**: Winsock2 (included by default in Windows)

### 2. Tools Needed on the Server
- **Netcat** (or alternatives like Socat) to create the listener.

## üìã Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Set Up the Listener on the Attacker's Server
1.1. Compile and launch the server code: `./server`

1.2. Wait for incoming connections from the malware.

### 2. Execute the Malware on the Victim‚Äôs Machine

#### 2.1. Transfer the Malware
- Move the `shell.exe` file to the target machine using one of the following methods:
  - **USB drive**
  - **File-sharing platforms**
  - **Remote upload**

#### 2.2. Run the Executable
- Execute the `shell.exe` file on the victim‚Äôs machine.  
- Once executed, the malware will:
  - Attempt to connect to the attacker‚Äôs server using the predefined **IP address** and **port**.
  - Establish a reverse shell session, providing remote access to the victim‚Äôs terminal.

### 3. Gain Control of the Victim's Machine

#### 3.1. Establish the Connection
- Once the victim executes the malware, a **reverse shell** connection will be established.  
- You can now access the victim‚Äôs terminal through **Netcat**.

#### 3.2. Execute Remote Commands
- Use the terminal session to remotely execute commands on the victim‚Äôs machine.  
- Example commands you can run:
  - **File exploration**: `dir` (Windows) or `ls` (Linux)
  - **Download files**: Use `curl` or `wget` if available.
  - **System monitoring**: `tasklist` (Windows) or `top` (Linux)
 
## üîÆ Future Improvements

### 1. Add Encryption
- Implement **encryption protocols** (e.g., AES or RSA) to secure data transfer between the attacker and the victim.
- Ensure stealthier connections by making traffic less detectable by network monitoring tools.

### 2. Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Extend support for other operating systems such as:
  - **Linux**
  - **macOS**
- Refactor the codebase to use platform-independent libraries for socket communication.

### 3. Firewall/Antivirus Evasion
- Develop advanced methods to bypass:
  - **Firewalls**: Use techniques like packet fragmentation or tunneling.
  - **Antivirus Detection**: Implement techniques such as obfuscation, polymorphic code, or process injection.
